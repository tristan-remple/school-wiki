NETWORKING OVERVIEW & GRADING

10 lab assignments will be the grade -> no exams
if you don't get it, more will be added

brightspace units
which are divided into modules
presentation > lab > packet tracer > evaluation
less a lecture more a discussion. powerpoint is chris' flashcards
you can download the powerpoints
email relevant links to chris, he will add them to brightspace

there are extra labs that won't be assigned, do them if you're curious
some of them are not the most efficient way to learn

labs are pretty much worksheets

packet tracers have a instructions doc and a .pka file
do it and then submit it via evaluation
submissions auto-include your w# and a timestamp

programming side vs systems side
it is normally assumed you're on one or the other

no textbook for networking and security
will be added to cisco network academy -> has more detail about n&s

learn how to configure business-class switch hardware
cisco is a major network hardware manufacturer
ccna certification step (i will not get that cert in this course)
cisco content has the textbook, which is supplemental
its really big
our brightspace course material numbers correspond to cisco textbook
cisco textbook has optional quizes and exams
feel free to ask questions about supplemental

learn how the internet works on a hardware level

learn about ip addresses and how to convert them

ethernet uses frames (of information)

learn about routers and their configuration

talk about security: firewalls and passwords etc

end project: build a whole network
(build and troubleshoot)

PACKET TRACER

cisco packet tracer program is available to download. its yours to keep forever
packet-tracer: free software through cisco -> localhost network bigger (.pka files)

packet tracer allows you to estimate power consumption for virtual mockups of computer labs
allows you to figure out all the hardware and interactions of a building before buying it
also set up servers for hosting
shows you how fast the setup will be
shows the lights on each machine
can set up multiple buildings, even multiple cities
can view in diagram or in a more "street view" way
change the way the routers are stacked in the tower

DEFINITONS

packet-tracer: free software through cisco -> localhost network bigger (.pka files)

iot: internet of things (door opener, carbon monoxide sensor, etc)

switch: where all the network cables connect to in a building

plenum: space between the visual ceiling and the concrete ceiling (where hvac and cables go)

ftp: file transfer protocol
