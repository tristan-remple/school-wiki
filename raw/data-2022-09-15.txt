data consistency and integrety

data entity and attribute

entity can be physical object or more abstract like an event or group
-object or thing

attribute: property that an entity has

simple attribute: atomic value, cannot be further divided

composite attribute: made of multiple simple attributes, ie a name= given/family name

derived attribute: aren't in the database but can be calculated using the data in the db

record is uniquely identifable via a key

better for a database to grow vertically than horizontally > more scaleable

how to identify an entity in a real-life scenario

use visual paradigm to plan and visualize databases

watch videos about normalization

key: ID / unique attribute of an entity
