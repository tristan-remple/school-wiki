looking at the first lab

-lab / classroom lab: designed to be printed and filled out
-packet tracer lab: done in packet tracer

numbers in brightspace connect to the cisco lab textbook numbers

not doing many classroom labs in this course

packet tracer labs come in two parts:
-instructions / form to fill out (docx)
-packet tracer file (pka)

-pka: packet tracer assessment - includes instructions and auto-marking
-pkt: default file format for packet tracer

you can email pka/pkt files to chris for advice, but not for submissions

each module has an assessment which might ask for the docx or the pka or both
it will be clearly labeled on brightspace what you need to upload

the instructions in the pka word file and the docx are the same text
pka instruction text non-editable

pka pop-out instructions contain the progress percentage, which is your mark

recommended to read the objectives instead of skipping to instructions

solid lines are wired

dashed lines are wireless (sideways dashes)

click a cloud to see the wiring inside it
click the back arrow to escape the cloud back to the main page

click on a device and go to the CLI tab to access its programming
cli: command line interface
tooltip: text that appears when you hover something
change fonts on CLI by preferences > font > router IOS

can copy+paste configs from packet tracer to real routers etc

cisco IOS basic command reference (1244-page book, free)

even device-specifc pdfs from cisco are hundreds of pages

some pka files have locked elements

ip phone is a kind of landland phone (not a cell phone)
-it has an ip address, unlike your home phone

media connection: nothing to do with audio-video. media = medium/connection

chris does not want essays. be concise.

client/server model:
-similar to client-side vs server-side code
-clients receive things, servers distribute things

transmission

010101 represents an electrical signal being on or off (generally 5v)
the signal is read on a regular increment of time

manchester encoding: +5v and -5v - 1/10mil of a second interval - 10 mbps

modern encoding is up to 1gbps - 1bil increments in a second
 -every piece of hardware involved has to be up to speed

both the sender and the receiver have to go at that speed
and the wire has to handle it

electricity travels AROUND copper wires, not in the middle of them

we have yet to hit the limit of fiberoptic connection speed
the transmitters cant hit that limit
26 years ago, we managed 1tb per second in a controlled environment

leased line: a phone line that doesnt transmit phone service. it transmits internet only
-t1/t3 is a leased line. e1 is the european equivalent

optical carrier lines: fiberoptic lease lines

the internet has backbone cables that connect different regions
generally not made or maintained by isps
exa infrastructure is a company that makes subnautical cables
isps pay to use these highway/backbone cables

we can get bonus marks for the challenge questions

we do not need to put our name on assignments for networking
theyre stamped with our name and the time by brightspace

rfs: ready for service
