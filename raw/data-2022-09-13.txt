database 22-09-13

consider plr for this?

centralized database: database stored at a single site
distributed database: not centralized, has more hierarchy
cloud database: database stored on the internet

general purpose database: variety
discipline-specific database: specialized info for one job ie. medical, legal
operational database: stores transactions and other day-to-day operations

noSQL: collects data without relational structure. object-oriented

data: raw facts
field: a character/string/etc used to define data. a place where data is stored.
record: (row) a connected set of fields
file: (table) collection of related records

file system cons:
-takes a long time to make
-can't query easily
-complex administration
-no security or integrity
-extensive programming

structural dependence:
-access to a file is dependent on its structure
-like putting a table in a word file
-you can only access files which are in their correct location

structural independence:
-file structure can be changed without compromising access to the data

data dependence:
-data access changes when data storage characterics change

data independence:
-can change data characteristics without compromising access

data redundancy: unnecessarily storing the same info in multiple places
-increases the likelihood of inconsistency

a database management system can be used for multiple databases

whitelists should be used instead of blacklists for access

database administration is not the highest paid job but you can always get it

noSQL allows rows to have different columns

mongoDB is a noSQL database

learn about database normalization -> watch videos
-1st normal form (1NF)
   -get rid of duplicate columns
   -split up data where possible (one data per field)
   -each row must be unique
-2nd normal form (2NF)
-3rd normal form (3NF)

entity: thing that has properties

attribute: property that an entity has. used like a variable.
