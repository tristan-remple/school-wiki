end device has network card
connects to a jack

jack has a punchdown which connects to another cable which goes between rooms to the communications closet

jack: "outlet" for ethernet/internet

rack unit: 1.75"
a rack-mounted object has a height that is measured in "U" (rack unit)
42u rack can contain 42 instances of 1u devices

usually put power units on the bottom
switches, routers, servers go on racks

servers are like desktop towers but flat

full rack weighs a lot and costs a lot, so its bolted to the floor

patch panel: accepts network cables from jacks
  -normally at the top of the rack
  -then connects to the switch. switch has ports which accepts cables

switch: connects devices together to form a LAN

home-use switches are "unmanaged" - they connect a set number of devices directly

business-class switched are "managed" - they let you tell them what to do
-lots of ethernet ports - use these to connect to the patch panel
-sometimes better ports (gigabit fiber ports)
-generally rack-mounted 1u

best practice is to label each patch panel port with the jack it connects to

switch ports are counted in columns first, then rows
1 3 5 7
2 4 6 8

fixed configuration: you cannot change the number or type of ports

nm: network module. the plug-and-play components of non-fixed switches

bay contains nms

ports are numbered 0/1 0/2 0/3 etc
the 0 means either that its fixed or that its the first nm of an unfixed switch
on multiple bays, the second one will be 1/1 1/2 1/3 etc
