an operating system is the intermediary between the programs and the hardware

driver tells the OS what the hardware elements are and need
drivers: software that communicates between hardware and your OS
-make it so that apps dont need to compensate for every possible model of every possible device/component

operating systems: windows, linux, iOS, android

all progams have hardware requirements

32-bit can only use 4gb of memory/ram

32gb minimum disc space for win10 is the bare minimum for installation

an operating system has 3 parts
-hardware: all parts and ports
-kernel: communicates between the hardware and the software using drivers
-shell: the part of the OS that you see. user interface
-drivers have to correspond to the kernel

cli: command line interface
gui: graphic user interface
audio interfaces also exist
