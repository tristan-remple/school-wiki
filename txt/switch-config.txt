console port: allows you to plug in a device and enter command prompts

command line devices - generally use a laptop
connect the serial port of the laptop to the console port on the switch

cisco IOS: internetwork operating system. unrelated to iOS (apple)
-tell it what to do with its ports
-security
-everything else
-has SO MANY commands, which you can find in their pdf for free, but its also. SO big

switches are designed to last for decades and handle a LOT of traffic
a home router can handle industrial traffic for approx 3 seconds before it implodes
an industrial switch is worth about $2500 and will last 20 years (situationally)

an operating system has 3 parts
-hardware: all parts and ports
-kernel: communicates between the hardware and the software using drivers
-shell: the part of the OS that you see. user interface
drivers have to correspond to the kernel

cli: command line interface
gui: graphic user interface
audio interfaces also exist

cli are less resource-intensive and more stable, but less user-friendly
cisco devices are normally cli not gui (some exceptions for routers)

serial: one bit at a time
usb: univeral serial bus

console cable: serial connection at one end, ethernet-looking one on the other (console port. not the same)
-used to plug a laptop into a switch
-new ones are usb

ssh: secure shell - remote connection instead of console cable. encrypted
-cant be used until the device has an ip address
telnet: unencrypted version of ssh. its bad

terminal emulation program: includes PuTTY and Tera Term and hyperterminal
-once youre plugged in, use this to enter the cli
-allows the laptop to emulate the switch

switches dont have a power button
you plug it in and its on. forever.
a real switch takes a minute to boot

all cisco port configuration
9600 bits (speed - faster than your typing speed)
8 data bits (1 byte - 1 character)
1 stop bits (tells it when the data bit is done)
parity/flow control only matter for modems

cli are not backdated. you see stuff from when you plug in onwards
no command history from before you arrive
