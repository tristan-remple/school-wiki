NETWORKING

networking is communication and connection
it is extremely important to everything, highly integrated

NETWORK DEVICES

host device: any device being used by a person, which has an IP address. see also: end device
end device: host device; places where data originates or arrives

server: device which provice services to end devices.
-email, web, etc.
-has multiple clients
-more powerful than an end device

client: device which sends requests to servers
-obtain webpages, emails, etc

intermediary: device which connects end devices (router, etc).
-regenerates and directs signals
-sends error logs

NETWORK MEDIUMS (HARDWARE)

they cannot be pure enough, so theyre not perfectly efficient
laser is an acronym: light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation

copper wiring - electric impulses sent through copper wires. the cheapest/slowest
fiberoptics - glass transmission of light pulses
wireless - uses radio waves

near-field communication: tap technology and etc

there are cables running across the ocean

"its how we touch the machine"

DSL: digital subscriber line. dedicated to internet only

lease line: business-specific internet cables, direct to the ISP

satellite still used where cables cannot go
keep in mind that not everyone has access to the same technology

power outlets can be used for internet with an adapter

convergence: put all your networks and connections in one place/cable
-can include internet, phone, etc

NIC: network interface card. wifi, bluetooth, etc. often integrated into the motherboard.
physical port: place where you can plug something in
interface: the data associated with a physical port

NETWORK TYPES

peer-to-peer: no centralized server, devices act as both client and server
-easy to set up
-less reliable

LAN: local area network, a network within one physical location. often has one admin company. faster.
WAN: wide area network. the internet is one. often has multiple admin organizations.

Less useful ones:

MAN: metropolitan area network, ex university campus or military base
HAN: home area network, is also a LAN.
PAN: personal area network, includes all the bluetooth devices on your person and more
SOHO: small office / home office

networks are nested
some grey area

demarcation point: where the WAN connects to the LAN

ISP: internet service provider
the internet does not belong to anyone, you pay for the delivery
some organizations help to govern it and structure it
IETF: internet engineering task force

intranet: a private network. not available to outsiders. the HR/finances/email of an organization, etc.
extranet: provides a limited connection to your intranet to outsiders, such as customers and allies.

extranet will be very relevant to us

topology diagram: shows where things in the network are in relation to each other
-physical: shows where things are in the meatspace
-logical: shows how the machines relate to each other

NETWORK FEATURES

reliability:
-quality of service (QoS): prioritizing
-fault tolerance: measures to minimize the impact of failures. recovery possible. multiple paths for each route
-scalability: potential to grow
-security: busiest. functionality vs risk

these factors are often in opposition

installation is not the end. there are endless adjustments to do
maintenance is the core of it

queuing is important. order of tasks

confidentiality
integrity
availability

TRENDS

byod: bring your own device
online collaboration
video communication
cloud computing

allowing personal devices on business networks introduces security risks

cloud: anything that is stored online. all email is cloud storage
clouds can be public, private, etc

aas: as a service

geofencing: registers when a device enters a "fenced" area or leaves
-mostly used to show relevant ads

threat actors: hackers

ACL: access control list
IPS: intrustion prevention system
IDS: intrusion detection system
