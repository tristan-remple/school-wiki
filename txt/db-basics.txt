Types of Database

centralized database: database stored at a single site
distributed database: not centralized, has more hierarchy
cloud database: database stored on the internet

general purpose database: variety
discipline-specific database: specialized info for one job ie. medical, legal
operational database: stores transactions and other day-to-day operations

noSQL: collects data without relational structure
-object-oriented
-allows rows to have different columns
>mongoDB is a noSQL database

file system (non-database data storage ie. excel sheets) cons:
-takes a long time to make
-can't query easily
-complex administration
-no security or integrity
-extensive programming

What's In a Database?

data: raw facts
field: a character/string/etc used to define data. a place where data is stored.
record: (row) a connected set of fields
file: (table) collection of related records
key: ID / unique attribute of an entity

entity: thing that has properties
attribute: property that an entity has. used like a variable

simple attribute: atomic value, cannot be further divided. simple
composite attribute: made of multiple simple attributes, ie a name: given/family name
derived attribute: aren't in the database but can be calculated using the data in the db

a database is stored in and managed with a Database Management System
-a database management system can be used for multiple databases

Database Characteristics

structural dependence:
-access to a file is dependent on its structure
-like putting a table in a word file
-you can only access files which are in their correct location

structural independence:
-file structure can be changed without compromising access to the data

data dependence:
-data access changes when data storage characterics change

data independence:
-can change data characteristics without compromising access

data redundancy: unnecessarily storing the same info in multiple places
-increases the likelihood of inconsistency

security:
-whitelists should be used instead of blacklists for access

better for a database to grow vertically than horizontally > more scaleable
