Basic Syntax

() after a word in javascript notes that its a function
a word with no () is a variable
you can put parameters into the ()

. is an action within a function

// single-line comment in js
/* multiple line comment in js */

\ is the escape character - prevents one punctuation mark from being run as code

you can use var to declare variables in this course
(there are other ways)

Testing Code with CLI

command "node" when node.js is installed
"node [filename]" runs the file in the command window

console.log prints text
\n - creates a new line in output

using the up arrow in the command window repeats the last command

Readline Sync

gets input from a CLI user

use "npm install readline-sync" in the console to install the readlineSync package
"var readlineSync = require('readline-sync');" goes at the top of your code to enable it

use case example:
var earningsPerShare = readlineSync.question("How much did you earn per share this year?");

this returns a STRING all the time. use parseInt to convert integers
